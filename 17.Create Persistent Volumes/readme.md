1. Create a PersistentVolume named as pv-datacenter. Configure the spec as storage class should be manual, set capacity to 3Gi, set access mode to ReadWriteOnce, volume type should be hostPath and set path to /mnt/security (this directory is already created, you might not be able to access it directly, so you need not to worry about it).
2. Create a PersistentVolumeClaim named as pvc-datacenter. Configure the spec as storage class should be manual, request 3Gi of the storage, set access mode to ReadWriteOnce.
3. Create a pod named as pod-datacenter, mount the persistent volume you created with claim name pvc-datacenter at document root of the web server, the container within the pod should be named as container-datacenter using image httpd with latest tag only (remember to mention the tag i.e httpd:latest).
4. Create a node port type service named web-datacenter using node port 30008 to expose the web server running within the pod.
